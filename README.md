# Login-Page-with-encryption-java
Login page with data encryption and decryption of credentials.

This code is solely witten in JAVA by me and its free to use as long as you don't consider the code as your's.

Details:
This program will show a login page as soon as you run it and as soon as you enters your credentials and press "Sign Up", it will encrypt your crendentials and save it to "C:\Users\username\Documents\Details\Credentials.txt". Note that the encryption is very basic and can be cracked easily.

Now you can use the same credentials to login (or create instance of another class) as long as the "Credentials.txt" is not deleted or modified manually. The program will read and decrypt the credentials in the file and compare it to the credentials you entered, if both matches, then it will print "IT'S WORKING!" and will close the gui.

Features of the program:
* Can store credentials for future login (Credentials will be encrypted)
* Can add new credentials
* You can use it to create instance of other class and it will work as a login system
* Can change theme of the page (Light and Dark)
* and Many More!

Details (About Code):
* You can change line 139 to do it what you want to as soon as you login (Create instance of another GUI class and it will launch that)
* The code is easy to understand and its under 200 lines of code
* If you need any help regarding the code, contact me on telegram at @SOUL_AYU

Issues:
* I did not find any issue till now except weak encryption logic (you can change it according to yourself)

--> You can download the .jar file from release section and import it in Eclipse or Intellij IDE.
